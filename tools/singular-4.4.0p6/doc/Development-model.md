New git-supported Development Model {#development_model_page}
===================================


* development is to be done within personal (github) forks of the Sources repository
* the main Sources repository hosts only _official_ master and spielwiese branches
* there are a few people with push access to the Sources repository, who handle pull requests to master and spielwiese (Hans, Christian, Oleksandr)
