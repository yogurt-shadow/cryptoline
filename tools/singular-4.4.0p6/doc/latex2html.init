# This number will determine the size of the equations, special characters,

### Navigation Panel ##########################################################
#
# The navigation panel is constructed out of buttons and section titles.
# These can be configured in any combination with arbitrary text and
# HTML tags interspersed between them.
# The buttons available are:
# $PREVIOUS - points to the previous section
# $UP  - points up to the "parent" section
# $NEXT - points to the next section
# $NEXT_GROUP - points to the next "group" section
# $PREVIOUS_GROUP - points to the previous "group" section
# $CONTENTS - points to the contents page if there is one
# $INDEX - points to the index page if there is one
#
# If the corresponding section exists the button will contain an
# active link to that section. If the corresponding section does
# not exist the button will be inactive.
#
# Also for each of the $PREVIOUS $UP $NEXT $NEXT_GROUP and $PREVIOUS_GROUP
# buttons there are equivalent $PREVIOUS_TITLE, $UP_TITLE, etc variables
# which contain the titles of their corresponding sections.
# Each title is empty if there is no corresponding section.
#
# The subroutine below constructs the navigation panels in each page.
# Feel free to mix and match buttons, titles, your own text, your logos,
# and arbitrary HTML (the "." is the Perl concatenation operator).
sub top_navigation_panel {
#
#     # Now add a few buttons with a space between them
#     "$NEXT $UP $PREVIOUS $CONTENTS $INDEX $CUSTOM_BUTTONS" .
#
#     "<BR>\n" .		# Line break
#
#     # If ``next'' section exists, add its title to the navigation panel
#     ($NEXT_TITLE ? "<B> Next:</B> $NEXT_TITLE\n" : undef) .
#
#     # Similarly with the ``up'' title ...
#     ($UP_TITLE ? "<B>Up:</B> $UP_TITLE\n" : undef) .
